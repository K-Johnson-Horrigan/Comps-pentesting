attack concept: 
ld_preload

attack walkthrough:
1. listen on apropriate port on kali
2. from slab victim ubuntu, sudo run the one script we're allowed to sudo run, but preload something 
   (thus getting sudo privledge for the preload script)
3. then from the kali machine you are now root! 

Other questions: 
- get script to cslab (easy)
- get cslab to run it (harder to ensure)
    - do this through www-data 
    - e.g. www-data has sudo priv to do some task like backups, and we're going to exploit that :)

Scenario:
- some admin has to have sudo priv to run some script
- but! maliciously! we make them preload another script which gives our remote shell root access :)
